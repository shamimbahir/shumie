       My name is Junaid As, everyone has got a different set of qualities, when you are writing an essay about yourself, you are supposed to write what you are in most interesting, engaging and creative manner. While you write you think about yourself and you know yourself better regarding your qualities and capabilities. This will increase your self awareness and interest apart from keeping you engaged without getting bored.
